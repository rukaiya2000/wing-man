# Working in this repo

## Capture stated opinions into memory, live

`memory/` holds what's been learned about the founder's voice, topics, and
preferences — see `memory/MEMORY.md` and the "Founder memory" section of
`README.md`. It updates two ways, both automatic, no explicit user request
needed for either: every skill that touches Notion runs the procedure in
`.codex/memory-update-procedure.md` as its own last step, every time it runs
(it's a fast no-op when there's no new evidence); and this instruction, for
anything the founder says directly.

**Whenever the founder states a preference, opinion, like, or dislike
directly in conversation** — including short, casual, or context-dependent
remarks typed straight into the terminal ("I don't like this", "not a fan
of that one", "meh, skip it", "yeah I like that angle") and not just fully
spelled-out statements ("I don't like when...", "I prefer...") — **append it
immediately** to the relevant memory file's `## Founder notes (manual —
preserved on regeneration)` section, in the same turn, without waiting to be
asked and without waiting for a skill run to pick it up. Don't ask
permission first; just do it and mention it briefly.

- **Resolve the referent before saving.** "I don't like this" on its own is
  useless read back later — write down what "this" concretely was (the
  specific draft text, the reply angle, the topic, the row) plus the
  reaction, not the bare pronoun. If the referent genuinely isn't clear from
  context, ask a quick clarifying question rather than guessing or saving
  something vague.
- One line per note, dated (`YYYY-MM-DD`), in the founder's own terms rather
  than paraphrased into something vaguer.
- Append — never rewrite or remove earlier founder notes, and never edit the
  generated sections above that marker (that's what the automatic per-skill
  update, `.codex/memory-update-procedure.md`, regenerates from real
  activity).
- Pick the file by what the opinion is actually about:
  - `memory/x-voice.md` — how they want X posts/replies to sound
  - `memory/x-topics.md` — what to engage with or avoid on X
  - `memory/outreach-voice.md` / `memory/outreach-topics.md` — same, for
    paper outreach
  - `memory/preferences.md` — anything cross-cutting or that doesn't fit a
    single platform
- If none of the 5 files exist yet, this instruction doesn't apply —
  `memory/` hasn't been set up.

## Wing-Man hard rules

- Codex CLI is the interaction surface; Notion is the review/output surface.
- Use a Codex skill for workflow rules, then MCP for external systems. Use a
  purpose-built adapter only for a system with no suitable configured MCP.
- For every configured MCP call, retry once on failure. If the retry fails,
  stop the workflow and report a clear error. Never substitute a local tool,
  direct API, or another source as a fallback for that failed MCP operation.
- Never send messages, publish or schedule posts, or operate an authenticated
  founder LinkedIn browser session.
- Never choose outreach recipients silently. Write evidence-backed review rows.
- Use one focused query per run unless the founder explicitly requests a batch.
- Notion rows may use only `New`, `Reviewed`, and `Rejected`. Skills may create
  `New`; the founder owns `Reviewed` and `Rejected`.
- Before creating leads, deduplicate by `LinkedIn URL`. Before creating X
  opportunities, deduplicate by `Tweet URL`.
- X and GitHub MCP access is read-only. Notion is the only allowed integration
  write path and only for the review schemas in `schemas/notion.md`.
